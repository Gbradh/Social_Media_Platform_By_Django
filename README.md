# Social_Media_Platform_By_Django

This Social Media Platform is used to posting the content for their supporters and the user also post the content on the group according to their point of view. 
When a user posts the content, their supporters can comment, freezes, save, or download their post. In this Django project, when a user tries to find the other users, 
they go from explore button on navbar and going to their profile or chat with them. If the use is authenticated, he/she is doing anything from the navbar 
but is the user is not authenticated then there is few things shows on the navbar which is Login, 
Signup and groups navbar-items which is show all the group available on this project.

The waterfall Model is a linear sequential flow. 
In which progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through the phases of software implementation. 
This means that any phase in the development process begins only if the previous phase is complete. 
The waterfall approach does not define the process to go back to the previous phase to handle changes in requirement. 
The waterfall approach is the earliest approach that was used for software development.

The benefit of using “Django based Social Media Project” over its social network, 
if user get some information’s, mems, photos, songs, videos, related thing they can easily get through this network and post on this social media platform.
