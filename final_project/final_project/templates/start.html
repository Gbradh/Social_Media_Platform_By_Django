     <p>Social media are interactive technologies that allow the creation or sharing/exchange of information, ideas,
       career interests, and other forms of expression via virtual communities and networks.
       While challenges to the definition of social media arise due to the broad variety of stand-alone and built-in social-media services
       currently available, there are some common features:
       <div class="container-fluid">

           <li>
             Social media are interactive Web 2.0 Internet-based applications.
           </li>
           <li>
             User-generated content—such as text posts or comments, digital photos or videos,
             and data generated through all online interactions—is the lifeblood of social media.
           </li>
           <li>
             Users create service-specific profiles for the website or app that are designed and
             maintained by the social-media organization.
           </li>
          <li>
            Social media helps the development of online social networks by connecting a user's
            profile with those of other individuals or groups
